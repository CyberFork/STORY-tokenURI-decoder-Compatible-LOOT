# [STORY-tokenURI-decoder-Compatible-LOOT](https://cyberfork.github.io/STORY-tokenURI-decoder-Compatible-LOOT/)

Each story has nine hints, each hint is made by p-C-a-r-e (plotMark - COMPONENT- additional - rarity - extral Role).
The nine hints type is: time/weather/space/object/role/motion/element/location/sign.

✒️When tokenURI returns pictures in SVG format, you can use any screenshot program that supports text writing for secondary authoring.
OPTION: You can write the token id and timestamp or date on the right side of the sheet.
OPTION: You can write down the story you understand about the hints sheet, and whatever's good, even though it's empty, you don't have to care about any rules.

You can use hints to write stories with your imagination and share them with other people.

The text at the bottom can also be either text that does not describe a story, any foreground, game design, role-playing, character close-ups, or any other topic.
